# ABAP OO Design Pattern

This repository contains a small set of implementations of
object-oriented design patterns written in ABAP. The implementation
are supplementary material to a presentation for the ABAP CodeRetreat
2017 in Weinsberg. All the patterns showcased in the original version
were used in production code and have proven to be useful. 

# Contributions 

We believe this repository could become a useful resource for examples
of design patterns in ABAP. Therefore we welcome any kind of
contribution to this repository in the form of issues and
pull-requests. We also plan to contribute further patterns to this
repository.
